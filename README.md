# BoilerTutor

This project was an effort by me and a couple of other students to create a service for Purdue students to easily find and connect with tutors around campus. It is a full stack app that utilizies Express, React, and a MySQL database on google cloud.

# Note

There are no demos for this project as it is discontinued and the database we were using has been lost. A valid database is needed in order to preview the product properly.
